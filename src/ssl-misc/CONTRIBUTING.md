# Contributing to KRSSG - SSL Repositories

This is a set of guidelines to be followed by **everyone** (especially 1st years) for contributing to the SSL code of KRSSG.

***
*If you don't know how to use git, [learn its basics](https://try.github.io) first*
***

#### Proposing Changes and Bug Fixes
* Use your best judgement, and feel free to propose any changes to the codebase.
* Any self proposed idea should be first discussed with other members (and owners) as an Issue in the corresponding repo, and only after affirmation from an **owner**, should you start with the code and send a PR.
* Any bugs found should also be reported as an issue, filed with the bug-report and the changes required to fix it. After affirmation, you can send a PR.
Bug-report should contain the following:
    * Use a clear and descriptive title
    * Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem
    * Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps
    * Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why
    * You *could* include screenshots

#### Creating Issues
* Title should be deciptive
* Do provide refernces to codes or other issues, if required.

#### Creating pull requests
* Before making changes to your local code, make sure you have pulled the latest version from the org.
* Proper indentation of the code is a must.
* Make sure to add comments to the changes you have made, so that it is easily understood by others.
* Use a seperate branch with a descriptive name, then push it to your fork and send a PR from that branch. DO NOT send a PR from your master.
* DO NOT send PR's containing a huge number of commits, squash them first.
* Use git features like `git commit --amend` to reduce the number of commits.
* Use [proper markdown syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) while writing documentation.

#### For owners
* You are also constrained by the above rules.
* DO NOT push anything directly to the master branch, send a PR to a branch and then merge it!
